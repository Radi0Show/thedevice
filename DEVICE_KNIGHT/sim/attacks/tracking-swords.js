// obj_tracking_swords_manager + obj_tracking_sword1 — dc.type 151.
//
// The selector reaches this type from myattackchoice 11 (phase 1 turn 2) and
// 14 (phase 3 turn 13), and type 154's vortex chains into it for turn 9 — so
// three of the fight's fifteen turns.
//
// (An earlier version of this note claimed ac 16 and 17 as well. They sit in
// phase 1's block at phaseturn 7 and 8, which the phase never reaches: turn 5
// sets `phase = 2; phaseturn = 0`. See CLAUDE.md, THE REAL FIGHT.)
//
// Shape: swords appear one at a time at a fixed distance from the soul,
// pointing inward. Each fades in, holds, flashes, then slashes straight
// through the soul's position along its own heading. The sword TRACKS the soul
// until it commits (con 2), so the dodge is about where you are when it locks,
// not where you are when it fires.
//
//   con 0   5 frames: alpha 0 -> 0.5, still tracking
//   con 1   30 frames: alpha 0.8 -> 1, len creeps out by 10, still tracking
//   con 2   flashtime+1 = 5 frames: LOCKED, no longer tracking
//   con 3   t1 aim, t2 spawn the slash hitbox, t5 destroy
//
// The manager's cadence tightens as the turn goes on: `rate` starts at 32 and
// drops by `ratedecay` 4 per sword down to `rateminimum` 16 — measured spawn
// gaps 28, 24, 20, 16, 16, 16, 16.
//
// The anti-repeat pass is the interesting bit. `directionprev` remembers the
// last few headings and nudges a repeat by 45 degrees until it is free, so the
// same corner never fires twice in a row — that is what stops the attack from
// being unfair rather than hard. The oracle traces replay POST-wheel headings
// (tools/scenes/oracle-tracking.js), so no trace diff can see it at all;
// `tools/verify-tracking-wheel.mjs` covers it on its guarantee and its
// execution instead, and is sabotage-checked.
//
// The launch streak and the manager's additive, box-clipped slash surface ARE
// drawn now (render/draw/swords.js). NOT translated: the sword's
// afterimage_grow trail, and obj_tracking_sword_slash_extra_graze, which exists
// only to award TP and shave turntimer on a graze (out of scope: dodge-only).
