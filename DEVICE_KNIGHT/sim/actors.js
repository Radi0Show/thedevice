// no ACT menu — and nothing here can affect a single frame of bullet state.
// They exist because an empty arena does not read as the Knight fight.
//
// They live in sim/ rather than render/ because their sprite and frame are
// instance state, advanced by the engine's animation phase exactly like a
// bullet's, so the renderer stays a pure function of sim state.

// turn 3 with the universal harness. The camera sits at (0,0) for the whole

   * records as costing many game runs and presenting as four unrelated bugs.

   * 37-pixel slot at x 168, and this keeps you inside it. Now that ac 0 is
   * translated the line finally has its attack around it, and it is gated the
