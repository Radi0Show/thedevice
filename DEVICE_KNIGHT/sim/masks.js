// Collision masks, extracted from the data file (sim/data/masks.json).
//
// Measured facts these encode — all verified against the oracle trace
// t3-hold-right / t3-diagnostic:
//
//   - obj_heart's mask is spr_dodgeheartmask: 20x20, Precise, heart-shaped,
//     bbox inset to [2,2]..[17,17]. NOT a 20x20 rect. The soul rests at
//     x=374 against the box's right wall precisely because its rightmost
//     pixel is at x+17.
//   - The battle box (obj_growtangle, whose parent is obj_battlesolid — the
//     wall IS the box) collides with spr_battlebg_0's mask: a 75x75 hollow
//     ring, ~2px border, drawn scaled. At battle scale 2 and box (320,170):
//     interior spans world x 250..391 for the soul.
//
// Sampling model, oracle-calibrated (traces/t4-contact-hits.csv and the
// sub-pixel sweep — 41 data points, all reproduced by `masksOverlap`;
// tools/verify-contact.mjs replays them):
//
//   1. Instance positions are FLOORED before the test. (The 20/20 misses at
//      fractional spawn y require it.)
//   2. B's transformed bbox is rounded to an integer world rectangle —
//      floor on the min edge, ceil-1 on the max — and pixels outside it are
//      never tested. This pre-check, not sampling, is what makes an
//      axis-aligned mask thinner than 1px unhittable (yscale ramp threshold
//      exactly 1.0; same mask at 30/45/60/135 degrees connects, 0/90 miss).
//   3. Surviving pixels sample by inverse transform at the pixel CORNER
//      with floor. (The ramp discriminates corner from centre sampling:
//      centre wrongly hits at yscale 0.5-0.9.)
//
// VALIDATED ENVELOPE: integer A positions; B at angles 0/30/45/60/90/135,
// scales 0.1-5.0, floored positions. The T3 grow-in (rotating fractional-
// scale box, frames 0-3) also matches this model EXACTLY once the box state
// live during the heart's Step is taken as timer=row rather than row+1 —
// free, block x3, free, all six observations. So the earlier "growth window
// contradiction" was a frame-alignment assumption, not a sampling failure.
// The grow animation still isn't modelled in sim/battlebox.js; when it is,
// pin that alignment with a dedicated trace. New attacks at unusual
// angle/scale combinations should get an oracle spot-check before being
// trusted.

// Static import, not a filesystem read: sim/ runs in the browser as well as
// under Node, and the architecture rule is that it touches neither the DOM
// nor the filesystem. Regenerate the data module with tools/gen-masks.mjs.
