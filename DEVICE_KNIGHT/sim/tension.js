// TENSION — TP, and the graze that earns it.
//
// `global.maxtension = 250` (scr_gamestart). TP is not a reward for hitting
// things; in this fight it comes almost entirely from GRAZING — letting a
// bullet pass close without touching you — which is why the tension bar is the
// dodge-only scope's natural scoreboard.
//
// THE GRAZE BOX is `obj_grazebox`, created by obj_heart's Create at
// `(x + 10, y + 10)` — the soul's centre, not its corner — carrying
// `spr_grazemask`: 50x50, origin (25,25), and flagged AxisAlignedRect, so it is
// a plain square and needs no pixel mask.
//
// `obj_grazebox`'s Collision with obj_collidebullet, in full:
//
//     if (!other.active && other.object_index != obj_sword_tunnel_sword) exit;
//     if (global.inv < 0) {
//         if (grazed == 1) {                       // still inside
//             scr_tensionheal((grazepoints / 30) * grazetpfactor);
//             if (global.turntimer >= 10) global.turntimer -= (timepoints / 30) * f;
//         }
//         if (grazed == 0) {                       // just entered
//             grazed = 1;
//             scr_tensionheal(grazepoints * grazetpfactor);
//             if (global.turntimer >= 10) global.turntimer -= timepoints * f;
//         }
//     }
//
// So entering pays the full `grazepoints` ONCE and staying pays a thirtieth of
// it per frame — a second of hugging a bullet is worth the same as entering it
// twice. It also SHORTENS THE TURN by `timepoints`, which is the real reason
// grazing matters: a turn spent grazing ends measurably sooner.
//
// The sword tunnel's swords graze even while inactive — the one exception in
// that first line, and it is the corridor's whole design: the swords are
// inactive between sub-steps but you are still shaving past them.
//
// `grazetpfactor` and `grazetimefactor` start at 1 and are modified by armour
// ids 15, 24, 3, 9 and 14. This fight's loadout (1, 10, and optionally 23) is
// not among them, so both stay exactly 1.
