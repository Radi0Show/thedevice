// THE FIGHT'S DIALOGUE — obj_knight_enemy's Step.
//
// It is a TWO-BEAT EXCHANGE, one per turn, and reading it as a single stream
// of lines gets the shape wrong:
//
//     balloonturn++;                       once a turn, and ONLY if Susie
//                                          is alive (`global.hp[2] > 0`)
//     balloonturn == N  ->  the Knight's taunt, and `ballooncon = N - 5`
//     button3_p() or the writer finishing  ->  Susie's reply for that
//                                              ballooncon, then ballooncon = 0
//
// So the Knight speaks, you press C, Susie answers. Both balloons, one turn.
//
// **IT STARTS ON TURN 6.** `balloonturn` counts from 0 and the first line is
// at 6, so the first five turns are silent — the taunting begins once the
// fight has gone on long enough to be going badly.
//
// **IT STOPS IF SUSIE FALLS.** The increment is inside `if (global.hp[2] > 0)`,
// so a downed Susie freezes the exchange where it stands rather than skipping
// ahead. She is the one being talked to.
//
// `&` is GameMaker's line break inside a message; `/%` closes it.

/**
 * ONE CHARACTER A FRAME — measured, not estimated.

 * This was 2, from a note that said typer 81 reveals "roughly two characters
 * a frame". It reveals one. `scr_texttype` passes `rate` into
 * `scr_textsetup(font, colour, x, y, charline, shake, RATE, sound, hspace,
 * vspace, special)`, and both typers this fight uses are rate 1:
 *
 *     case 75: scr_textsetup(dotumche, c_black, x, y, 33, 0, 1, snd_txtsus, 9, 20, 0)
 *     case 81: scr_textsetup(dotumche, c_black, x, y, 33, 0, 1, snd_tv_voice_short, 9, 20, 0)
 *
 * and the writer's Alarm 0 re-arms with `alarm[0] = rate` while advancing
 * `pos += 1` once. Alarms 1 and 2 only play the voice blip — neither adds a
 * character, which is what makes "two a frame" wrong rather than a rounding.
 * So the Susie exchange was typing at DOUBLE speed; the battle-message box
 * was already correct because its call site passes `1` explicitly.
 *
 * PURE TEXT LOGIC, so it lives in sim/ rather than render/. The turn loop has
 * to know when a line has finished typing (to decide whether Z advances or
 * the line auto-holds), and a sim module importing from render/ to find that
 * out is the dependency arrow pointing the wrong way — sim/ is the half that
 * must run headless.
