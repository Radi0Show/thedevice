// THE FIGHT'S REAL ATTACK ORDER, and the dispatch that launches each one.
//
// Everything here is read out of the game rather than arranged: the turn table
// comes from `obj_knight_enemy`'s Other_10 (the SELECTOR — see CLAUDE.md, "THE
// REAL FIGHT"), and the per-attack setup below comes from the knight's Step,
// which is what actually positions the arena and starts the clock.
//
// Nothing in this file invents a schedule. The previous playable scene looped
// one attack because the roster was incomplete; this replaces that.
//
// WHAT IS STILL A STAND-IN, stated plainly because the rule is that nothing
// invented ships unlabelled:
//
//   * The cone's spawn point for Stars is MEASURED from the recording rather
//     than computed — obj_dbulletcontroller's type-98 branch that creates it
//     is not translated, only the star spawner it drives.
//   * Between-turn cleanup stands in for the battle controller's end-of-turn
//     bullet sweep.
//
// NO LONGER A STAND-IN: the turn system is modelled (the party acts, then the
// Knight does), and phase 4 is entered on the real `monsterhp <= maxhp * 0.8`
// gate at the end of any turn rather than on a turn count.

 * The selector's phase blocks are a run of plain `if (phase == N)` tests, not

 * `phaseturn` INSIDE that run. So the transition falls through into the next
 * phase's block in the same call with `phaseturn == 0`, which matches none of
 * its `phaseturn == 1..5` tests and therefore changes nothing.
 *
 * That fall-through is what makes PHASE 1 FIVE TURNS. Its `phaseturn == 5`
 * branch sets `phase = 2; phaseturn = 0`, so the `phaseturn == 6/7/8/9`
 * branches below it cannot fire — not that call, and not the next one, by
 * which time `phase` is 2. Attacks 12 (diagonal), 16, 17 (tracking variants)
 * and 7 (combination) are therefore UNREACHABLE in a real fight; the only way
 * in is `if (scr_debug() && overrideAttack > 0) phaseturn = overrideAttack`.
 * They are debug content, the same class as ac 6 underboxattack.
 *

 * time on this project that reading a table instead of the control flow
