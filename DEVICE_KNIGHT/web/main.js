 * HOW THE 640x480 FRAME MEETS THE WINDOW — a GRAPHICS setting, because the

 *   FULL   fill the window, letterboxed on the short axis. The default, and
 *          what fullscreen should look like.
 *   SMALL  scale by a WHOLE number of DEVICE pixels, leaving black around the
 *          edges when the window is not a clean multiple of 640x480.
 *
 * The trade is unavoidable. `image-rendering: pixelated` at a fractional
 * factor gives some source columns n device pixels and their neighbours n + 1,
 * so a one-pixel font stem is fat on one letter and thin on the next — the
 * "weird" menu text. SMALL is the only mode that cannot do that; FULL is the
 * only one that fills the screen. Measuring in DEVICE pixels is what makes
 * SMALL exact: a 2x display turns 640 CSS px into 1280 real ones, and only the
 * real count has to divide evenly.
 *
 * FULL used to be the only behaviour, then SMALL was, and each was reported as
 * a regression by the other's standard. Now it is a switch.
